Outline - Regional Foods Website
~ Sergio Buchanan, Adaeze Greathouse & Linda Schasch
The Regional Foods website will show foods unique to certain regions of the United States.  The users will be able to click on links to cities which they may visit. Each city will have its own page which will have a brief overview of the city and its unique food (ex: St. Louis > Toasted Ravioli).  They will also have an option to search for restaurants that feature that unique food. The idea came from traveling across the USA, and wanted to experience new foods and find restaurants outside of chain restaurants. 
Features: 
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application to be able to search the site.
Search: Users will be able to search cities to discover unique foods and then search an API by keyword to find restaurants with that food.
API: Users will be able to search in the API link with a key word to pull up restaurants in the area they are located.
Technologies::
C# (MVC)
Bootstrap
MySQL
API
What you’ll have to learn: We will have to learn how to use an API and link it to each city page. If we can’t figure out the API in a timely manner, we are considering switching the project to one that a user enters a city and foods they think are unique to that city.
